Vegetation Textures:
a) Must follow the same naming convention as terrain textures. Currently, normal maps are not supported.
b) In addition, must have their textures set to "Read/Write Enabled" in the Texture importer.


For reference, the Terrain naming conventions are as follows:

Terrain Textures:
a) Must following the following naming convention for each pair of textures.
	"*_c" or "*_Diffuse" = colormap
	"*_n" or "*_Normal" = normalmap
	where * must be the same string for both the colormap and normalmap.
	ex: Beach_c.png, Beach_n.png; Grass_c.bmp, Grass_n.bmp.
